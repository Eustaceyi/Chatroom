# Chatroom
 This includes an **UNSECURE** tiny multiuser chatroom. This application does not even try to secure communication. All data is sent between hosts completely in the clear.

This is a smaple interface that users will be shown.

If you want to try this tiny chatroom, you can download this repo and config the IP address and socket number in the [Controller](https://github.com/Eustaceyi/Chatroom/blob/master/src/Chatroom/Controller.java), also in the [Server](https://github.com/Eustaceyi/Chatroom/blob/master/Server.java).
